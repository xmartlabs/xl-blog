Some weeks ago, we decided to host a webinar about artificial intelligence (AI). This might seem an obvious move in today's “AI hype” context, where it is not uncommon for our LinkedIn feed or other social networks to be flooded with the word. For better or worse, AI has become ubiquitous in daily life for many. As founders and business managers, how should we approach this new reality?

Several of these concerns are faced daily by the sales and pre-sales team, who deal with founders constantly and are steeped in the reality of startups. This is why we wanted to bring our own perspective to the discussion, contributing what we see from our consulting side.

To that end, we partnered with [](https://www.notion.so/Webinar-recap-AI-Beyond-the-Hype-d5a659ae872b43a2b3973a0b741612e4?pvs=21)[Angel Squad](https://xmartlabs.com/angel-squad) to host the webinar "AI: Beyond the Hype" with [Bruno Ferrari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunoferrariuy/) (XL's Principal) to help people at this crossroads decide and evaluate the incorporation of AI from a pragmatic and strategic place.

We've come up with this written recap to get you up to speed in case you missed it. You can always check out the recording, but we hope to capture the webinar's spirit in this blog!

AI's Current State

GenAI achieved in months, which took decades in terms of innovation a few years ago. Take, for example, the creation of the first mobile phone (a Motorola) in 1973 and the launch of the first iPhone in 2007. The evolution that mobile phones had in that 34-year gap took only two years in terms of GenAI.  

In terms of innovation and to continue the metaphor, OpenAI has positioned itself as the Apple of the AI world. Despite other companies lik making significant advances and research in LLMs, OpenAI introduced GenAI to the mainstream public. At the end of November 2022, ChatGPT became a household name, and only five months later (March 2023), they released GPT-4, a model so advanced it can pass as a human more than 50% of the time
