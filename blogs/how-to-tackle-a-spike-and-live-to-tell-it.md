Imagine yourself as a new Software Developer, eager to tackle exciting challenges. Then comes your first Spike. It seems harmless at first‚Äîuntil you're buried in documentation, shady forums, and endless YouTube tutorials. And after all that suffering, in most of the cases, you have to make a decision that will impact your team. *Panic.*

This was exactly the situation I found myself in recently, facing my first Spike. Now, I‚Äôm here to share what I wish I had known before starting.

Let‚Äôs go for it!

## First of all, what exactly is a Spike?

If you‚Äôre a recent developer or unfamiliar with Agile methodologies, you may be wondering: what is a Spike?

According to what Mike Cohn explains in his video ‚ÄúWhat is a Spike on Agile?‚Äù, *‚ÄúA Spike is an activity a team performs to get smarter about something. With a Spike, a team isn‚Äôt trying to immediately deliver a new capability, instead, they are building the knowledge that will allow them to deliver the new capability later‚Äù*.

A Spike is focused on investigation. It could involve exploring a new tool, technology, architecture, or any topic relevant to the team and the project.

The goal of a Spike is to generate knowledge and reduce risks. For example, assuming you can use an API without proper investigation might result in useless code and wasted time (speaking from experience here üòÖ).

Even though you may be tempted to create a Spike for every single task, it‚Äôs important to practice moderation. A Spike requires a significant investment of time, and you certainly *don‚Äôt need one to align a div*.

A team may opt, for example, to use a Spike to explore whether an external service offers what is needed for a task to be completed, or to learn about the most recent updates on the framework they are working with.



### What should I expect from it?

It‚Äôs important to have clear expectations about what a Spike can achieve, and it‚Äôs also important to recognize that the outcomes might not align with the team's expectations.

While the most common result is gaining knowledge about the investigation topic, this new information might lead to changes in plans or the need to consider alternative approaches to tackling an issue. As a team, it‚Äôs also crucial to be prepared for the possibility that the investigation could lead to a dead end.

Regardless of the outcome, remember that no amount of work can eliminate uncertainty, but reduce it. Work around this, make your best effort, and avoid wasting time!
