NFC is a communication protocol that enables two devices to share data within a range of up to 4 cm, launched to the public in 2004. This technology is usually used to share personal or critical data between two devices, since its range restrictions make it more secure than Bluetooth.

With the release of iOS 11 back in 2017, Apple added support for NFC applications. By providing a native iOS SDK you can integrate into iOS apps, it joined Google and other device manufacturers that already supported the protocol. As a result, the amount of devices with NFC integration capabilities on the market has widely increased.

In this post we will explore some real-world use cases to put the benefits of this technology on display.

NFC is not a newcomer when it comes to payments.

These have proven to be very secure and also very convenient, since the number of smartphones and NFC-enabled POS terminals have been increasing over the past few years, adding to the ability to pay however you want without having to take your cash, credit/debit card or checkbook out of your home.

Furthermore, NFC-based payment methods have been accepted in a wide variety of stores, banks and other entities all around the world.

Some of the aspects that makes these keys a very secure and convenient method are the ability to activate new keys or invalidate them. Furthermore, they can be programed to give certain access in defined conditions for example allow the key to unlock only between a certain period of time.
