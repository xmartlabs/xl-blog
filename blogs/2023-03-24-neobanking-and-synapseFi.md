## Understanding Neobanking

### What is Neobanking

Neobanking is a new banking model that provides a fully digital platform for customers to access banking services. Unlike traditional banks, neobanks have no physical presence and operate 100% online. They have as a result of the digital transformation in the United Kingdom and Germany and have rapidly expanded throughout Europe, with the recent introduction in Latin America.

One of the main advantages of neobanks is that customers can access banking services easily and quickly without the need to visit a physical branch. Neobanks offer a seamless online experience through an experiential digital layer on top of traditional banking. Customers can create accounts and use their offerings seamlessly due to their technology-driven nature.

Moreover, neobanks often offer competitive rates, low fees, and personalized services. These services are accessible to a broad range of customers, especially millennials who are tech-savvy and prefer a digital experience. The involvement of neobanks in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is also a contributing factor to their popularity. The use of AI in financial services enhances the customer experience and provides personalized services that traditional banks may not offer.

With the increasing popularity of neobanking, it's likely that we'll see further development in this area as more fintech companies enter the market, and traditional banks look to compete by investing in their own digital platforms.

### Neobanking Characteristics

Neobanks are rapidly becoming a popular option for customers who prioritize user experience, convenience, and cost savings. These digital banks provide an array of benefits that cater to the needs of new-age users and constantly work to improve the overall customer experience. Here are some key characteristics that make neobanking an attractive option for users:

**Savings Accounts**: Neobanks provide a hassle-free way to open a savings account without the long wait times associated with traditional banks. They offer the ability to open accounts quickly, and even receive a physical card if required.

**Credit Accounts**: Through strategic alliances with various commercial entities, neobanks offer credit cards with numerous benefits.

**Loans**: In addition to credit accounts, neobanks also offer a variety of services such as individual and start-up loans. They also aim to serve unbanked communities, contributing significantly to economic growth in different countries.

**Lower operating costs**: Neobanks have low or no maintenance costs, which translates to lower fees and interest rates for customers. The absence of physical branches allows neobanks to pass on cost efficiencies to their clients.

**Improved user experience**: Neobanks operate through easy-to-use applications that provide real-time financial information for users. Since operations are 100% systematized, they are designed to be intuitive and operate via cell phones, catering to the needs of digital natives.

### Neobanking vs. Traditional Banking

Neobanks and digital banks are similar in many ways, but they have some crucial differences. While digital banks are online branches of traditional banks, which offer digital services to online customers while supporting traditional banking, neobanks are 100% digital and independent of traditional banks. Furthermore, neobanks do not have physical branches like traditional banks and instead offer a variety of services and benefits through digital media, which are built using the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence models.

Despite traditional banks adapting to the current situation by offering technological solutions, neobanks have exceeded the percentage of users compared to traditional banks in some countries, such as Brazil and Argentina. Among the most popular neobanks, Nubank stands out, founded in Brazil, with about 50 million users in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Another popular option is Ualá, founded in Argentina, which has around 5 million users in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.

### Types of Neobanking

There are three main types of neobank:

**Front-end neobank:** This type of neobank focuses on the front end and does not have an operating banking license. It is usually backed by a traditional financial institution and operates in partnership with these entities to provide services to its clients. They generally use the traditional bank's balance sheets to operate.

**Digital banking units**: Stand-alone or independent digital banks are the digital arms of an established bank. These entities must obtain a virtual banking license to operate, which can be obtained once they have sufficient capital to secure deposits from their investors.

**Full-stack digital banks**: Full-stack digital banks have the required bank regulatory approvals and provide a wide selection of services. They issue deposits and loans and maintain their independent brand and balance sheets, in an increasingly digital environment, these banks are not burdened by costly physical branch networks.

## Getting Started with SynapseFi

To get started with exploring the SynapseFi API and integrating the services to a neobanking platform, follow the steps detailed below.

### Create and integrate a SynapseFi account

![synapse account.gif](/images/neobanking-and-synapseFi/synapse_account.gif)

- The first step is to create a sandbox account, for that, you must navigate to the [website](https://uat-dashboard.synapsefi.com/on-boarding/auth/signup) provided by Synapsefi, and perform the respective signUp process.
- The next step is to perform the onboarding process, here you can enter false or real information, which will facilitate the process of moving to production once everything is tested.
- For the account configuration, the platform itself provides a [guide](https://help.synapsefi.com/hc/en-us/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.synapsefi.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360057990714-How-to-setup-a-developer-account) with the required steps. Regarding the creation of the billing account, you must use a valid [routing number](https://developer.wepay.com/docs/articles/testing) corresponding to a bank.
- After completing the onboarding process and saving the account configuration, the next step is to go to the [overview](https://uat-dashboard.synapsefi.com/v2/auth/signin) page to generate the credentials needed to integrate the application.
- The next step recommended in the guide is to download and import the Postman collection with the respective environment variables to test all API resources.
- Once the collection and variables have been imported into Postman, it is required to replace the client_id and client_secret variables previously generated in the Synapse platform.

After exploring the available endpoints, you can start with the implementation. In the case of NodeJs, there are two integration options, using the SDK, which is the [node-synapse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-synapse) library, or making the API calls directly using libraries such as axios or fetch.

In this practical example with Typescript and Express, direct API calls will be made, since the library does not have typing available yet.

The services were implemented according to the API documentation, which specifies all the resources and the respective options provided by each of the endpoints.

- The API entry point available to date is [https://api.synapsefi.com/v3.1/](https://api.synapsefi.com/v3.1/), to consume the resources, by default, the headers 'X-SP-USER', 'X-SP-USER-IP', 'X-SP-USER', among others must be sent depending on the resource being consumed.

```bash
X-SP-GATEWAY: <client_id_###>|<client_secret_###>
X-SP-USER-IP: 255.127.79.76
X-SP-USER: |<user_id>
```

- The first service that was addressed is the query of the users associated with the account, the response includes an array of json objects. The parameters that can be used are _per_page_, _page_, and _show_refresh_tokens_.

```yaml
GET https://api.synapsefi.com/v3.1/users?show_refresh_tokens=yes&per_page=10&page=1 HTTP/1.1

- The following service corresponds to the subscription to events. To be able to make this subscription, two parameters are required, the _scope_, which represents so to speak the categories of events that you want to track, and the URL, which corresponds to the client that will be listening to the messages that will be issued. In this case, you can create an account in [pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) which provides you with a URL to receive the messages issued. This call returns a json object with the subscription information.

### Going to Production with SynapseFi

In order to go into production using Synapse services, a series of phases must be completed to verify that the technical and legal requirements for providing a neobanking platform are met.

- **Phase 1: Configuration**
  This process starts with the creation and configuration of an account in the platform, in this configuration all the legal information of the company must be provided.
  Once the account is created and configured, a call will be scheduled with a Synapse commercial agent, where the following points must be explained.
  1. Implementation schedule.
  2. Specification sheet of the product to be implemented with all the relevant controls it will have.
  3. The API guide to be implemented.
  4. Guide of good practices to be included.
- **Phase 2: Initial Testing.**
  The platform will provide a test environment with all the necessary resources so that all the functionalities supported by Synapse resources can be tested, such tests should include the following:
  1. Card creation and configuration with card printers.
  2. Card generation with networks.
  3. Generation of mobile and third party wallets.
  4. Account integration with banks.
     As part of the process, Synapse will request a series of documents to verify compliance with legal and marketing requirements. For this stage, a reserve account must also be in place, as a backup for possible losses that may be generated.
     At this point of the implementation, end customers should be clearly informed that the application is in Beta, this is important if there are regulatory inquiries while the implementation is being finalized.
     It should be noted that even with bank approval, the Synapse API will limit the number of users for Beta testing.
- **Phase 3: Beta Testing.**
  In this phase, the respective approvals from the associated banks will also be received, based on the documentation previously submitted. If everything is approved correctly, the limit on the number of users will be eliminated.
- **Phase 4: Deploy an application to production.**
  Once all the implementation points have been verified, the Synapse team will make a complete guide of all the possibilities that the platform offers as a service.
  In the first weeks, after generating information, Synapse will provide support to verify that everything is running correctly.
  Depending on the type of services offered, Synapse will provide differentiated support and verification.
