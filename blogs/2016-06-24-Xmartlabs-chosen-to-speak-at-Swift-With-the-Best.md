This Saturday, June 25th, the world's top Swift developers will unite at [Swift With The Best](http://swift.withthebest.com/), the largest online conference series for mobile developers. Our team will have two speakers at the conference.

Mathias Claassen will talk about [Eureka](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka), an elegant iOS dynamic form builder which leverages all the new capabilities in Swift 2.0. Eureka speeds up form development, and Mathias will share how to create and structure forms, as well as managing events and basic customizations for your project. Eureka is an Open Source project built by Xmartlabs engineering team and currently used by more than 10,000 apps in production.

CTO Martin Barreto will introduce [Opera](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Opera), our latest Open Source project that can be used to display remote data in a UITableView. Opera leverages Swift language by compounding many OSS projects to provide a simple, reliable and maintainable way to retrieve and show remote data collections.

Come out and join us on Saturday! Mathias will be on the air at 12pm EST and Martin is the event's final speaker at 5pm EST.
