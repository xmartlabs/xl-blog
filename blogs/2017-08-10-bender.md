2 months ago we introduced [Bender]: a framework for real-time Neural Networks inference. And we wanted to talk a bit about it :)

# Nuts & Bolts of Bender

You may have a Machine Learning model you want to run smoothly on an iPhone. Either [style transfer](http://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/) or [image recognition](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition) (or many many others) are common tasks that would be nice to run on mobile to open the doors to several ideas.

Bender takes advantage of [Metal] and [Metal Performance Shaders] (MPS) to use the GPU in iOS, it runs as fast as lightning. And it supports models created in TensorFlow and in Caffe.

Here's a sample code:

```swift
import MetalBender

let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "myModel", withExtension: "pb")! // A TensorFlow model.
let network = Network.load(url: url, inputSize: LayerSize(h: 256, w: 256, f: 3))

network.run(input: /* … */) { output in
    // …
}
```

And that's pretty much it!

In the example, `myModel.pb` is a frozen TensorFlow graph that was imported using [Benderthon], which is a Python library to ease the task of freezing models. It also supports loading just a graph definition (without the variables values) and passing the parameter values using the `Network` parameter `parameterLoader`. And there's also a beautiful API to define the network:

```swift
let network = Network(inputSize: LayerSize(h: 256, w: 256, f: 3))

network.start
    ->> Convolution(convSize: ConvSize(outputChannels: 16, kernelSize: 3, stride: 2))
    ->> InstanceNorm()
    ->> Convolution(convSize: ConvSize(outputChannels: 32, kernelSize: 3, stride: 2), neuronType: .relu)
    ->> InstanceNorm()
    ->> FullyConnected(neurons: 128)
    ->> Neuron(type: .tanh)
    ->> FullyConnected(neurons: 10)
    ->> Softmax()

// …
```

The [repo includes some examples](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Bender) that contain a real-time digit classifier based on the MNIST dataset and a real-time style  transfer camera. You should take a look at them.

Soon we will be writing about Bender motivation and a comparison against other frameworks. So stay tuned!
