Maximo and Martin will be also giving a talk on mobile development, here's a little intro to it:
</p>
<p>
"In mobile development, choosing between native, web, and hybrid apps is a harsh task, as it depends heavily on the app's requirements.
In this talk we will go over the key issues you should take into account when making this decision, so that you can take the best approach when building a mobile app."
