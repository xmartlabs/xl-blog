## **Migrating to Contentful: Streamlining Data for Better Performance and Workflows**

Migrating from WordPress to a modern CMS like Contentful can supercharge your website’s performance, streamline content creation, and make life easier for everyone involved. In this guide, we'll walk you through our process, highlight key considerations, and share tips to ensure a smooth transition.

Using our client Robinson & Henry as an example, we’ll explore key steps and decisions that led to a seamless migration, without losing a single byte of data.

### Why Migrate to Contentful?

WordPress is a reliable CMS, but it does come with its challenges, like performance issues, dependence on heavy plugins, and some SEO constraints. Switching to Contentful offers you the chance to unlock:

* Faster site performance
* Cleaner workflows for content creators
* A modern, flexible data model

### Understanding Relationships Between Content Types

Before diving into migration tools, it’s essential to understand how your data is structured as this is key to ensuring smooth migration and accurate data mapping.  The first step is building a conceptual model using the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This step will help map out your existing WordPress content types and their relationships. With this visual reference, it becomes easier for everyone—from developers to stakeholders—to understand how the data will flow in the new system.

Pro tip: Focus on the big picture. We kept the diagram simple by leaving out details like the SEO content type, which had a straightforward 1:1 relationship with every other type.

### Streamlining Your Data Model

Once you’ve mapped your content, it’s time to optimize for better performance. Here’s what worked for us:

* **Simplifying Tags:** In WordPress, Tags were a separate content type but lacked reusability. We streamlined this by implementing them as a multivalued field within Articles and Case Results.
* **Simplifying “Ask Our Attorney”:** To declutter the model, we opted for a single-question, single-answer structure, ensuring simplicity for both users and developers.
* **Unifying Articles:** Instead of maintaining two distinct content types for articles, we merged them into one.
* **Merging Categories and Services:** We identified that these two content types were actually referring to the same concept. However, a few of their entries were written different like "Sex Crimes" and "Sex Crimes Defense.". In this process, we also unified them, eliminating redundancy and creating a more consistent and streamlined structure.

These adjustments simplify the model, and make it easier for content creators to work efficiently without worrying about data inconsistencies or overly complicated workflows.
