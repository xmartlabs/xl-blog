<p>
It is a common practice nowadays to be asked for a SMS number while registering to a site. Most of us do not want to share our phone number on the net to avoid being spammed, making it impossible to complete a registration process.
</p>
<p>
Luckily there are several free online services, offering the possibility of receiving and reading SMS with one of their many phone numbers. This particular <a href="https://receive-sms-online.com/" target="_blank">site</a>&nbsp;offers 6-8 &nbsp;numbers
which are periodically renewed, free of charge and without any registration needed.
</p>
This is great to test applications that charges for each SMS received or to keep to ourselves our real phone number.
