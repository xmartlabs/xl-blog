title: "TEST: Precision Agriculture and the Future of Farming With Machine Learning"
heading: Maintaining a plantation, whether itâ€™s for forestry or crops, has never
  been more expensive (costs per acre in the US have risen 170% since the 70s).
  And this is partly due to the increasing costs of maintaining weed-free
  fields.

Weed detection and control in small and large farms has become a challenge. Herbicide usage has increased ([527 million pounds in the last 20 years](https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2190-4715-24-24#:~:text=Herbicide%2Dresistant%20crop%20technology%20has,kilograms%20(123%20million%20pounds).))), and although its price has not necessarily decreased, never have people spent more on it (a whopping $6.6 billion yearly in the US alone).

Machine Learning andÂ [Computer Vision](https://blog.xmartlabs.com/blog/computer-vision-techniques-for-body-detection/)Â have provided solutions to tackle the challenges producers face regarding weed control. In the following post, weâ€™ll discuss the critical problems around herbicides and irrigation and how ML tech has helped reduce its economic and environmental costs.

## The problem with weed control in agriculture

Agricultural producers have to address three main problems when facing the issue of weeds growing amongst their plantations:

* The cost it infers.
* The damage to the soil.
* Resistance of the weeds to certain herbicides (which means more costs).
